      <h1>
      I got introduced to tech and the Internet through playing MUDs or text-based games on VT100 terminals.
      </h1>
      <p>
      You might remember them as the monochrome screens. I used to spend most of my days on these games.  I eventually went from just being a player to being a wizard and running my own MUD. This was how I was first introduced to a programming language. At the time, the language I used was LPC, a C-like language used to create game objects. It was through these worlds that I really enjoyed programming and wanted to do it in a professional setting.
      The experience of writing code in other programming languages has given me a baseline to be able to write code in web development.

      <p>Not only has it helped me to learn the fundamentals, but it has also shown me that you need to have patience, persistence, and a strong desire to work in this industry.
      I want to be able to contribute to the vast number of problems that are in this world by lending my skills to development. I think it’s important that we make a difference and one of the ways that we can do that is by building web applications to help a business or individual solve a particular challenge or need that they have.

<h2>I am currently focusing my time and energy on front end development specifically the MEAN stack.</h2>
<p>The first development project I did was on a team as part of a 48 hour hackathon. Our team created a hybrid (web/mobile) app to help customers/businesses schedule appointments smoothly.
I’ve learned a lot of fundamentals from books and programming courses from <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://www.codeacademy.com">Codeacademy</a>, and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com">Code School</a>. <p>When it comes to data structures and algorithms, I use Hackerrank or Project Euler. FreeCodeCamp is also a great resource for learning.

<p><h1> If you are just starting your career in programming, I recommend that you take your time. </h1>
  <p>Programming is an art form, it doesn’t happen in a week or even a month, it is something you have to continually work at to be good.
