      <h1>Around 11 years old, I got a CD from my cousin with Warcraft 1 on it. </h1>

      <p>It was my first RTS [real time strategy] and PC game.
      I was a gamer for a long time, and about five years ago I started fixing PCs on the side with my friend.
        <br /><br />  <img src='assets/mirza2.jpg'width="100%;" style='border-radius:12px;'><br /><br />
      In 2014, I got a few Microsoft certificates for supporting, installing and configuring Windows. At the end of 2014, I got a remote tech support job — I worked as a support technician for about 2 years.
      After that, I got to train a few newbies and got transferred to Quality Assurance.

      <p>Since I’m still a newbie, I’m learning the front end now, but in the future I’m hoping to go full stack with a
      focus on the back-end since I’m more interested in what goes on behind the scene, than in the visual
      aspects of web development.</p>

</figcaption>

          </figure>

      <p> I’m focusing on JavaScript now, starting with Angular soon.
      My first projects were the FCC [freeCodeCamp] small front-end projects,
      like the tribute page. Best advice I got was to code every single day, even for 10-15 minutes.</p>
      <p>
      My favorite development framework is Bootstrap, because it allows people without much of a sense for
      design make nice looking sites and it is a really handy way of making your website responsive which is a
      must nowadays.

      My hobbies are bike riding, listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G5rfPISIwo">heavy metal</a> or
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPlb9HoOCxs">old-school hip-hop</a>, or an occasional comedy or a sci-fi book. Also, I enjoy meditating and listening to spiritual music.
