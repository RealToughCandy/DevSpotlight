                    <h1 class="header_nicey">My mom bought my first computer for fifty dollars from a guy named Roger Grondahl
                      in 1995 after moving from Chicago to Anchorage Alaska.
                    </h1>I lived most of what you might hear in a
                    gangsta rap song, yet here I sit. If you're Roger, thanks, if you know Roger tell him I said thanks.

                    The computer my mom bought from Roger was an IBM PS2 286 with a monochrome display,
                    30 megabyte hard drive, and 512 kilobytes of RAM.  Roger and his wife Julie literally
                    lived on coffee and cigarettes and I don't think I ever saw them eat anything other than potatos.
                    They had two kids and the entire family was addicted to computers and everything computer related, truly amazing people.
                    <p><p>The IBM 286 didn't come with a modem, so getting on the internet was impossible. When
                    I had enough money, Roger sold me an IBM 8080.
                     I would use the 8080 to dial into Roger's BBS machine where I
                     would mainly ask him questions about how to do things in DOS.  He eventually gave me a
                     book on DOS that I would go on to never read.  I would also use the 8080 to dial into the
                     Anchorage public library.  This is how I would get on the internet.
                    After using 30 floppy disks to install windows 3.1 on the PS2 I was able to
                    use a mouse and see images, but if I wanted to see images from the internet I would have to download them using the 8088 and transfer them to the PS2 using a program called LapLink and a special cable that was near impossible to find.

                    When I saved more money I was able to buy a computer I found in the newspaper.
                    The computer was an AT&T something or other that I bought from a woman with a cat.
                     I'm bringing up that cat because I'm allergic to cats and using that computer was slowly suffocating me. I spent countless hours in front of that computer struggling to breathe and pecking away at the keyboard.  Later on I had an aunt give me $1,400 to build her a machine.  I used that money to build two machines and kept one for myself -- not cool, I've regretted it ever since.
                    <p><p>After high school I joined the Army because my girlfriend at the time wanted to join the Army.  She hated it and got out. I really liked it and stayed for another 15 years and here I am now!
                    <h1 class="header_nicey"> I lived most of what you might hear in a gangsta rap song. yet here I sit.</h1>
                    <p>
                    The first thing the Army does is condition your mind and body.
                    Some internalize the lessons and become leaders, some remain followers, then there are some that end up like me.
                    Questioning everything. I started looking for answers anywhere I could find them. Anyone that I
                    would talk to me for more than 10 minutes I would pick their brains clean.
                    Who are you, why are you here, what do you care about.  This led me to start reading, and listening and watching.
                    In 15 years, I met maybe a hand full of people that were doing what they really wanted to do. The Army taught me self-reliance, intestinal fortitude, and perseverance.
                    I learned to accept responsibility for everything that happens to me, to never quit, to never accept defeat.
                    I learned to think! There is a solution to every problem, a cause to every effect; excuses are just excuses.<p>
                    For example, If someone ones to become a web developer, programmer, coder, whatever we want to call it...
                    All they need is a plan, a process,
                    commitment, and a willingness to never quit. She who will not be denied won't be denied.

                     <h2 class="header_nicey"> Anyone that
                    would talk to me for more than 10 minutes I would pick their brains clean.</h2>
                    <p>Right now I'm interested in developing a vast understanding of how to solve logical problems using JavaScript and being able to rapidly prototype, deploy, and market test products.
                    The easiest and fastest way to deploy and test a concept is via the internet.
                    JavaScript is the language of the internet, and has a low barrier to entry.
                    It's confusing at times but in its own way it forces the thinking developer to learn
                    all these other things that they may have never considered.

                    <p>I read a lot of books. If I don't understand what's going on in the book I go to YouTube and watch videos until I understand.  YouTube videos and Google lead all kinds of places.

                    I remember getting copies of Compute magazine. These magazines would have the source code for video games written in BASIC.
                    I’d slavishly type in the code by hand, trying to get those games to work.

My first exposure to the Internet was in a strictly consumer capacity. A former roommate had an i386 from which he ran a BBS. I ended moderating some of his boards. Later on, I got involved with chat rooms. I didn’t get into programming until the early 2000’s when I was living in San Diego. I was working as a copywriter for a friend’s startup, and was surrounded by developers. My curiosity got the better of me, and I started learning HTML 4.01, along with some early CSS.

Technology is the one field that (in an ideal scenario) does not discriminate. It doesn’t matter who you are or where you’re from provided that you can write clean, maintainable code that works. <h2 class="header_nicey">There is a current revolution in tech right now. It’s not based on the newest tool set or JavaScript framework.</h2> It’s based on the free dissemination and sharing of knowledge that anyone can access. I want to be part of this new and exciting world.
<p><p>
Currently, I like <a href="https://www.vuejs.org" style="text-decoration:underline;"class="lowlight">Vue.js.</a> I’m particularly fond of its scalability. In smaller projects you can treat Vue in a similar manner that you would treat jQuery. For larger projects, you can treat it more like React by breaking down your application into components. I also like that it’s easier to pass data between components in Vue.







<p><p>Ultimately, I want a job where I can make technology better for those with disabilities, and for our aging population.  <figure><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/08/28/05/15/las-vegas-911499_1280.jpg" class="mini_pic"/>
    <figcaption class="mini_pic" style=" text-align:center; font-style:italic">After his graveyard shifts at an Oklahoma casino as a janitor, Michael would work on his web development project in the IT room.

    </figcaption></figure>I’m currently in my mid forties, and have mild cerebral palsy. The technology we use to create websites and applications has improved to such an extent that if it’s used correctly, the web can be accessible for everyone. However, many stakeholders and even some developers don’t realize that improving accessibility is not only the ethical thing to do, it also makes good financial sense. Ideally, I would love to be that person who works with businesses and government institutions to create a better web for everyone.
<p><p>
My first development project was the redesign of a casino website, in Northeastern Oklahoma. I was working as their overnight janitor at the time, and I’d come into the IT office to work on the project after my shift ended. This was back in 2011. Responsive Web Design had not caught on just yet, but I was able to employ the best practices of the day. The site has long since been redesigned, and I wish I held on to those project files for nostalgic value.

            <h3 class="header_nicey">Development is one of the most flexible careers within the IT industry.</h3> We, as developers, have the ability to work remote 100% and make a lot of money doing it.





               I want to pursue it all! I’m interested in multiple areas of development. Over the past couple of months,
               I’ve become a bit familiar with ReactJS, but also working to really understand Vanilla JavaScript.


               My first development project was when I created a website from scratch.
               I learned that it’s wayyyy more fun to customize a WordPress theme than building a personal website from scratch.
               I often lose track of time when working on a WordPress website. I think I found that *thing*.

                YouTube videos and books broken down to dummy terms such as “A Smarter Way To Learn JavaScript” by Mark Myers. I really enjoy the Udemy courses, but it also depends on the instructor.
                  My goal is to become a Freelance Developer regardless of my niche. Since I have a strong liking to WordPress, I’ll start learning PHP after JavaScript. Eventually, I’d like to gain some experience in iOS development as well. I won’t rush it though, because this is all a process.
                  I’m a huge Foodie, so I like to eat my way through the city, watch movies, and read about herbs and natural healing.

                    my mother is from the Pacific Islands -- Tonga, to be exact.

                    I developed the skill of being quiet and still for a long period of time which doesn’t feel much different
                    from coding. <p><p>    <h3 class="header_nicey">The difference in coding is, the patient is a logical piece of hardware - not an emotional human being.</h3>
                    <br />The other experience I’ve had was growing up in a Jackson 5 “ish” singing group for 15 years.
                    We sang and danced on stage wearing MC Hammer Pants and I developed a love for music, performance, and production.
                      All of these will be great assets in building software that will be on “stage” to perform for its users.
                      I love the creative aspect of coding.  That’s powerful to me.

                      <p><p>
                    I’ve worked with developers for the last four years building out ideas I’ve had.
                    I wasn’t necessarily inspired by them, but by the frustration of not being able to create what I wanted.  I
                     compare it to having somebody produce music for me to perform versus me creating myself.
                     I was driven by the desire for independence.
                     There is nothing worse than feeling like you could do it better yourself but you lack the skills to do it.
                     So I decided two years ago that I would create the space in my life to learn
                     this skill and build my own capacity to create software and build businesses my way.

                    <p><p><h2 class="header_nicey">My first development project was a website for my music portfolio.</h2>
                    I built it on a basic template from WordPress and modified the code a bit to suit my goals.
                    I quickly realized that I can totally jack up a website playing around with code I didn’t understand.
                    So I did this probably 10 more times with different projects and started to learn how to
                    read basic PHP and HTML/CSS. I learned that what looks “simple” to the user, can be quite
                    complicated on the back end! Since then I stopped referring to ideas I had as being a “simple” software project.

                  <p><p>  I’ve picked up a few development projects to build websites, but my main goal is to build a dev shop that can build and support the businesses I will be building.
                    I have one that is in the works, and three more that are coming down the pipeline so my goal is to build a
                    development team that can focus on DevOps style of projects to build MVPs fast and test them in the “wild” right away.
                    My goal is to be my first employee and build from there!
                    I love producing R&B and reggae music.  I have a music video called “That Feeling” </a>that is on Youtube.
                    I also have a few songs on my son’s youtube channel called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku9TtDCbpuE"
                    style="text-decoration:underline;"class="lowlight">Where is She Now</a>” and  “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku9TtDCbpuE"
                    style="text-decoration:underline;"class="lowlight">Love you Right.</a>”

You might remember them as the monochrome screens. I used to spend most of my days on these games.  I eventually went from just being a player to being a wizard and running my own MUD. This was how I was first introduced to a programming language. At the time, the language I used was LPC, a C-like language used to create game objects. It was through these worlds that I really enjoyed programming and wanted to do it in a professional setting.
The experience of writing code in other programming languages has given me a baseline to be able to write code in web development. <p><p>Not only has it helped me to learn the fundamentals, but it has also shown me that you need to have patience, persistence, and a strong desire to work in this industry.
I want to be able to contribute to the vast number of problems that are in this world by lending my skills to development. I think it’s important that we make a difference and one of the ways that we can do that is by building web applications to help a business or individual solve a particular challenge or need that they have.

The first development project I did was on a team as part of a 48 hour hackathon. Our team created a hybrid (web/mobile) app to help customers/businesses schedule appointments smoothly.
I’ve learned a lot of fundamentals from books and programming courses from <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com" style="text-decoration:underline;"class="lowlight">Treehouse</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com" style="text-decoration:underline;"class="lowlight">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://www.codeacademy.com" style="text-decoration:underline;"class="lowlight">Codeacademy</a>, and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com" style="text-decoration:underline;"class="lowlight">Code School</a>. <p><p>When it comes to data structures and algorithms, I use Hackerrank or Project Euler. FreeCodeCamp is also a great resource for learning.

<p><h1 class="header_nicey"> If you are just starting your career in programming, I recommend that you take your time. </h1>Programming is an art form, it doesn’t happen in a week or even a month, it is something you have to continually work at to be good.
