                    I remember getting copies of Compute magazine. These magazines would have the source code for video games written in BASIC.
                    I’d slavishly type in the code by hand, trying to get those games to work.

My first exposure to the Internet was in a strictly consumer capacity. A former roommate had an i386 from which he ran a BBS. I ended moderating some of his boards. Later on, I got involved with chat rooms. I didn’t get into programming until the early 2000’s when I was living in San Diego. I was working as a copywriter for a friend’s startup, and was surrounded by developers. My curiosity got the better of me, and I started learning HTML 4.01, along with some early CSS.

Technology is the one field that (in an ideal scenario) does not discriminate. It doesn’t matter who you are or where you’re from provided that you can write clean, maintainable code that works. There is a current revolution in tech right now. It’s not based on the newest tool set or JavaScript framework. It’s based on the free dissemination and sharing of knowledge that anyone can access. I want to be part of this new and exciting world.

Currently, I like Vue.js. I’m particularly fond of its scalability. In smaller projects you can treat Vue in a similar manner that you would treat jQuery. For larger projects, you can treat it more like React by breaking down your application into components. I also like that it’s easier to pass data between components in Vue.
vueMichael is digging Vue’s scalability.
<p><p>Ultimately, I want a job where I can make technology better for those with disabilities, and for our aging population. I’m currently in my mid forties, and have mild cerebral palsy. The technology we use to create websites and applications has improved to such an extent that if it’s used correctly, the web can be accessible for everyone. However, many stakeholders and even some developers don’t realize that improving accessibility is not only the ethical thing to do, it also makes good financial sense. Ideally, I would love to be that person who works with businesses and government institutions to create a better web for everyone.

My first development project was the redesign of a casino website, in Northeastern Oklahoma. I was working as their overnight janitor at the time, and I’d come into the IT office to work on the project after my shift ended. This was back in 2011. Responsive Web Design had not caught on just yet, but I was able to employ the best practices of the day. The site has long since been redesigned, and I wish I held on to those project files for nostalgic value.

After his graveyard shifts at an Oklahoma casino as a janitor, Michael would work on his web development project in the IT room.

                    When I saved more money I was able to buy a computer I found in the newspaper.
                    The computer was an AT&T something or other that I bought from a woman with a cat.
                     I'm bringing up that cat because I'm allergic to cats and using that computer was slowly suffocating me. I spent countless hours in front of that computer struggling to breathe and pecking away at the keyboard.  Later on I had an aunt give me $1,400 to build her a machine.  I used that money to build two machines and kept one for myself -- not cool, I've regretted it ever since.
                    <p><p>After high school I joined the Army because my girlfriend at the time wanted to join the Army.  She hated it and got out. I really liked it and stayed for another 15 years and here I am now!
                    <h1 class="header_nicey"> I lived most of what you might hear in a gangsta rap song. yet here I sit.</h1>
                    <p>
                    The first thing the Army does is condition your mind and body.
                    Some internalize the lessons and become leaders, some remain followers, then there are some that end up like me.
                    Questioning everything. I started looking for answers anywhere I could find them. Anyone that I
                    would talk to me for more than 10 minutes I would pick their brains clean.
                    Who are you, why are you here, what do you care about.  This led me to start reading, and listening and watching.
                    In 15 years, I met maybe a hand full of people that were doing what they really wanted to do. The Army taught me self-reliance, intestinal fortitude, and perseverance.
                    I learned to accept responsibility for everything that happens to me, to never quit, to never accept defeat.
                    I learned to think! There is a solution to every problem, a cause to every effect; excuses are just excuses.<p>
                    For example, If someone ones to become a web developer, programmer, coder, whatever we want to call it...
                    All they need is a plan, a process,
                    commitment, and a willingness to never quit. She who will not be denied won't be denied.

                     <h2 class="header_nicey"> Anyone that
                    would talk to me for more than 10 minutes I would pick their brains clean.</h2>
                    <p>Right now I'm interested in developing a vast understanding of how to solve logical problems using JavaScript and being able to rapidly prototype, deploy, and market test products.
                    The easiest and fastest way to deploy and test a concept is via the internet.
                    JavaScript is the language of the internet, and has a low barrier to entry.
                    It's confusing at times but in its own way it forces the thinking developer to learn
                    all these other things that they may have never considered.

                    <p>I read a lot of books. If I don't understand what's going on in the book I go to YouTube and watch videos until I understand.  YouTube videos and Google lead all kinds of places.
                    This is how I found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com" style="text-decoration:underline;"class="lowlight">freeCodeCamp</a> and <a class="lowlight" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=7UC8CneojQc&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fthe-web-developer-bootcamp%2F" style="text-decoration:underline;">Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp on Udemy.</a>
                    When I signed up for freeCodeCamp I was led to Gitter, where I can ask all kinds of programming questions.
                    <p>
                    I have had the good fortune of arriving at a place where little of what I do feels like work to me.
