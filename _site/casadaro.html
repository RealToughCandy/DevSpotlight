                  <h1>My mom bought my first computer for fifty dollars from a guy named Roger Grondahl
                    in 1995 after moving from Chicago to Anchorage, Alaska.
                  </h1><p>I lived most of what you might hear in a
                  gangsta rap song, yet here I sit. If you're Roger, thanks, if you know Roger tell him I said thanks.

                  The computer my mom bought from Roger was an IBM PS2 286 with a monochrome display,
                  30 megabyte hard drive, and 512 kilobytes of RAM.  Roger and his wife Julie literally
                  lived on coffee and cigarettes and I don't think I ever saw them eat anything other than potatos.
                  They had two kids and the entire family was addicted to computers and everything computer related, truly amazing people.
                  <br /><br /><img src='assets/casadaro.jpg' width="100%;" style='border-radius:12px;'>

                  <p><p>The IBM 286 didn't come with a modem, so getting on the internet was impossible. When
                  I had enough money, Roger sold me an IBM 8080.
                   I would use the 8080 to dial into Roger's BBS machine where I
                   would mainly ask him questions about how to do things in DOS.  He eventually gave me a
                   book on DOS that I would go on to never read.  I would also use the 8080 to dial into the
                   Anchorage public library.  This is how I would get on the internet.
                  After using 30 floppy disks to install windows 3.1 on the PS2 I was able to
                  use a mouse and see images, but if I wanted to see images from the internet I would have to download them using the 8088 and transfer them to the PS2 using a program called LapLink and a special cable that was near impossible to find.

                <p>
                  When I saved more money I was able to buy a computer I found in the newspaper.
                  The computer was an AT&T something or other that I bought from a woman with a cat.
                   I'm bringing up that cat because I'm allergic to cats and using that computer was slowly suffocating me. I spent countless hours in front of that computer struggling to breathe and pecking away at the keyboard.  Later on I had an aunt give me $1,400 to build her a machine.  I used that money to build two machines and kept one for myself -- not cool, I've regretted it ever since.
                  <br/><br />After high school I joined the Army because my girlfriend at the time wanted to join the Army.  She hated it and got out. I really liked it and stayed for another 15 years and here I am now!
                  <h1>   The first thing the Army does is condition your mind and body.</h1>
                  <p>

                  Some internalize the lessons and become leaders, some remain followers, then there are some that end up like me.
                  Questioning everything. I started looking for answers anywhere I could find them. Anyone that I
                  would talk to me for more than 10 minutes I would pick their brains clean.
                  Who are you, why are you here, what do you care about.  This led me to start reading, and listening and watching.
                  In 15 years, I met maybe a hand full of people that were doing what they really wanted to do. The Army taught me self-reliance, intestinal fortitude, and perseverance.
                  I learned to accept responsibility for everything that happens to me, to never quit, to never accept defeat.
                  I learned to think! There is a solution to every problem, a cause to every effect; excuses are just excuses.<p>

                      <br />
                  <p>For example, If someone ones to become a web developer, programmer, coder, whatever we want to call it...
                  All they need is a plan, a process,
                  commitment, and a willingness to never quit. <h2>She who will not be denied, won't be denied.</h2>


                  <p>Right now I'm interested in developing a vast understanding of how to solve logical problems using JavaScript and being able to rapidly prototype, deploy, and market test products.
                  The easiest and fastest way to deploy and test a concept is via the internet.
                  JavaScript is the language of the internet, and has a low barrier to entry.
                  It's confusing at times but in its own way it forces the thinking developer to learn
                  all these other things that they may have never considered.

                  <p>I read a lot of books. If I don't understand what's going on in the book I go to YouTube and watch videos until I understand.  YouTube videos and Google lead all kinds of places.
                  This is how I found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com">freeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=7UC8CneojQc&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fthe-web-developer-bootcamp%2F">Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp on Udemy.</a>
                  When I signed up for freeCodeCamp I was led to Gitter, where I can ask all kinds of programming questions.
                  <p>
                  I have had the good fortune of arriving at a place where little of what I do feels like work to me.
                  <p>
