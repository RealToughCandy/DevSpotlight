        <h1>My first experiences with tech and the Internet was at 14 years old.</h1><p> My mom bought me WebTV.
        In High School I enrolled in a Visual Basic course to get my feet wet in computer science.<br /><br />
        <img src='assets/elise.jpg'width="100%;" style='border-radius:12px;'>
        <br /><br />
        I enjoyed it so much that I thought my college major would be Computer Science, but I took a different path instead.
        <h3>The Air Force helped me develop a ‘NO-QUITTING’ attitude. </h3>
        <p>Well…I couldn’t quit my job without harsh consequences,
          so I learned quickly how to deal with crap and move on.<br />
          Disagreements happen and not everyone will like me, so I keep it professional,
          get the task(s) done, and move on.<br /><br />
        I think development is one of the most flexible careers within the IT industry. We, as developers, have the ability to work remote 100% and make a lot of money doing it.

      <h3>  I want to pursue it all!</h3> <p>I’m interested in multiple areas of development. Over the past couple of months, I’ve become a bit familiar with ReactJS, but also working to really understand Vanilla JavaScript.


        <p>My first development project was when I created a website from scratch. I learned that it’s wayyyy more fun to customize a WordPress theme than building a personal website from scratch. I often lose track of time when working on a WordPress website. I think I found that *thing*.
