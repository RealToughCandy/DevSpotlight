<h2>In Season One of Dev Spotlight, Elise confesses her recent love for Wordpress,
while Michael reveals his first interaction was with the Comodore Vic-20.</h2><br /><br />
<h3>What will Mirza think while still wrapped up in his own noble pursuit of Angular?</h3><br /><br />
<h2>It gets even more compelling as geographically-transplanted Casadaro reveals that
he questions everything.<br /><br />
Meanwhile, Dr. Kamea deploys a secret formula for managing tech teams as he
transitions from dentist to developer and Jim is just straight-up MEAN.</h2><br /><br />

<h1>It’s heating up here on Season One’s Dev Spotlight!</h1>
